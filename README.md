# Traffic-Flow-Estimation

This project aims at estimating traffic flow from CCTV footage. We have trained YOLOv4 for the following five vehicle classes.

* car
* bus
* truck
* van
* bike


We obtained the images through the traffic cameras API, New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA). The image dataset is avaialbele in the "traffic-detection-dataset" directory.

Our experimets were carried out for a footage we received from NZTA for a busy mult-lane road in Christchurch CBD.
